"""
Language Understanding for Complex NLP Tasks using meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct

This script demonstrates how to load the model and tokenizer using Hugging Face's transformers library 
to perform a deep language understanding analysis on a given input text. The analysis covers the text's 
underlying meaning, tone, sentiment, and key topics in a cohesive narrative form.

Requirements:
    - Python 3.8+
    - transformers (see requirements.txt)
    - torch (see requirements.txt)
    
Note:
    The meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct model is gated and requires authentication.
    Replace 'your_token_here' with your actual Hugging Face token or set it to True if you have already 
    authenticated via the Hugging Face CLI (huggingface-cli login).

    Due to the model's size (70B parameters), ensure your hardware (typically a high-memory GPU) meets the requirements.
"""

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Set your authentication token here:
auth_token = "your_token_here"  # Replace with your Hugging Face token or set to True if using CLI auth

# Load the tokenizer and model from the Hugging Face model hub with authentication
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", use_auth_token=auth_token)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", use_auth_token=auth_token)
